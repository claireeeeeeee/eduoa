Team 6 (EdUoA) Web-based Educational Application

For the project, we have developed a web-based application, which aims to improve the experience of online learning, for both the teachers and the students.
With our application, teachers and students are able to view the learning modules in a user-friendly tree view, and the modules are easily accessible just by clicking each node in the tree.
The quizzes in each module are also customizable with ease, teachers can change the questions in a quiz just with the click of a button, and students can take the quizzes on the interface, where their marks would be stored in a database, accessible by teachers through the profiles.
Teachers and students are also able to communicate with each other with our comment function, making the learning more personalized for the students, and the management of students simpler for the teachers.
The features are visually demonstrated thoroughly in our presentation video, linked in the Appendix.

Future Plans:
For future implementations, we plan to add features including, but not limited to
- Pages with learning materials for modules
- Option to skip modules given the performance of the placement test
- Option for teachers to personalize learning paths for students
- Allowing the teachers to add, edit, and delete modules in tree view.

Acknowledgments:
We would like to acknowledge ReactJS.org* for the detailed, interactive tutorials, that made learning and familiarizing with ReactJS uncomplicated.
Further tutorials and material we have used are
